=== Detailed Description
Change Requests are submitted through the CHG:ChangeInterface_Create form. When 
creating Change Requests via the Infrastructure Change Template facility, the 
Instance Id of related template is retreived using the template name parameter. 
The Instance Id is mapped to the TemplateID field on the 
CHG:ChangeInterface_Create form.  This causes Remedy workflow to map values 
from the template into the CHG:Infrastructure Change (Changes) form.

Additional information about the usage of Infrastructure Change Templates can
be found in the BMC Remedy ITSM Configurations guide.

The following data is used to create the 'CHG:ChangeInterface_Create' record:
* Sets the 'TemplateID' field to the Instance Id of the Change template that was
  specified in the "Change Template Name" parameter.
* Maps the deferral token of the task instance generated by this handler into
  the 'SRMSAOIGuid' field.

* Sets the following field values to the values of the specified parameters:
  - 'First Name'            => "Requester First Name"
  - 'Last Name'             => "Requester Last Name"
  - 'Customer Internet E-mail' => "Requester Email"
  - 'Company'               => "Requester Support Company"
  - 'Submitter'             => "Submitter Login Id"
  - 'Company3'              => "Change Manager Support Company"
  - 'Support Organization'  => "Change Manager Support Organization"
  - 'Support Group Name'    => "Change Manager Support Group Name"
  - 'SRID'                  => 'CustomerSurveyID' (the KSR number)
