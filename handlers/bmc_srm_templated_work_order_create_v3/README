=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the WOI:WorkOrderInterface_Create form &
functionality in ITSM to create work orders. This handler 
allows for creation of a work order using a template, but 
allowing the detail fields to be populated with request data.

Note that in 7.6.X version of ITSM, there have been issues 
reported with using WOI:WorkOrderInterface_Create to create 
work orders. This may need to be repaired in ITSM before this 
can effectively be used, but no changes are necessary in the 
handler.

This handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not 
rely on any @base information to process. All data is passed 
into the handler as parameters.
