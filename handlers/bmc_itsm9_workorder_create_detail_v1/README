=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the WOI:WorkOrderInterface_Create form &
functionality in ITSM to create work orders. This handler 
allows for creation of a work order without a template. 

Please be cautious hard coding shifting/frequently changing data
like Remedy Group names into task trees. It is a better strategy
to look up this data from somewhere (eg. a dataset in the 
Data Manageement Console or the Remedy Assignment Engine).

Note that in 7.6.X version of ITSM, there have been issues 
reported with using WOI:WorkOrderInterface_Create to create 
work orders. This may need to be repaired in ITSM before this 
can effectively be used, but no changes are necessary in the 
handler.
