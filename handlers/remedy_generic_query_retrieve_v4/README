=== Detailed Description
This handler has the ability to have form caching disabled.  To disable form caching set
disable_caching to "Yes".  Disabling caching may negatively impact performance, but it
is also necessary when using a single handler to interact with multiple Remedy
environments.

This handler returns all the fields for the request id provided
in the form specified for the "single" option. For the "all" option, it returns
a json string of the found entries.
