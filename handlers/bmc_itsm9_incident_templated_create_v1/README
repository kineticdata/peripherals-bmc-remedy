=== Detailed Description
Incidents are submitted through the HPD:IncidentInterface_Create form. When 
creating Incidents via the Incident Management Template facility, the Instance
Id of related template is retrieved using the template name parameter. The
Instance Id is mapped to the TemplateID field on the 
HPD:IncidentInterface_Create form.  This causes Remedy workflow to map values 
from the template into the 'HPD:Help Desk' (Incidents) form.

Additional information about the usage of Incident Management Templates can
be found in the BMC Remedy ITSM Configurations guide.
