== BMC_Execute_Process_V2
Runs a BMC Execute Process command



=== Parameters
[Command]
  The command and its parameters
[Wait for Server Response]
  Indicates whether the handler should wait for a server response or not


==== Sample Configuration
Command::                                Application-Command Approval "Add-Sig"  -s "CHG:Infrastructure Change" -e CRQ000000001031 -t "Change Level CI - Business" -o "tiggebk" -1 1  -2 999
Wait for Server Response::               Yes

Command::                                Application-Generate-GUID KR
Wait for Server Response::               Yes

=== Results
[Return Value]
  The value returned by the server after executing the command.  The value will 
  be blank if the 'Wait for Server Response' field is set to "No".  It will 
  also be empty if the command returns no values (e.g., commands to delete
  entries from forms).

[Return Status]
  The exit code returned by the process. Zero means success.

=== Detailed Description
Executes the command on the server exactly as submitted.  The command string 
can use results of other actions, such as ticket numbers, in its call.  The 
first example above adds an approver to a change request, using very specific 
parameters.  Refer to BMC's documentation for paramters that may require 
wrapping in quotation marks.
