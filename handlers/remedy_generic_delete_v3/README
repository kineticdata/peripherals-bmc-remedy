=== Detailed Description
This handler has the ability to have form caching disabled.  To disable form caching set
disable_caching to "Yes".  Disabling caching may negatively impact performance, but it
is also necessary when using a single handler to interact with multiple Remedy
environments.

This handler deletes the specified record in the form provided.
Note that this must be allowed by the system (form, permission, etc)
or the delete will raise an exception.
