  entry.  The value for 'Incident Entry ID' is automatically set by using the
  incident number to retrieve the request id of the incident entry.

BMC_ITSM7_IncidentWorkInfo_Create_V4 (2014-01-17)
* Added the option to set the View Access of the work log entry to either 
  Public or Internal.
  
BMC_ITSM7_IncidentWorkInfo_Create_v5 (2014-02-01)
* This handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base 
information to process. All data is passed into the handler as parameters.
