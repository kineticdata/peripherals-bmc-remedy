=== Detailed Description
Creates Work Info entries related to an Incident.  The relationship is
established by placing the Incident Number in the 'Incident Number' field on the
'HPD:Work Log' form.

The Include Review Request parameter invokes a method that builds and places
a link in the Notes field on the Work Info entry.  When this link is clicked,
the original service request submission is opened in the read-only Review
Request mode.

The Include Question Answers parameter invokes a method which builds a question
and answer pair display of the service request submittal. These data elements
are  placed in the Notes field of the Work Info entry.  This provides a quick
view of the triggering service request submittal data.

The Work Info entry accommodates up to three file attachments.  When configuring
the task, this handler expects the value Menu Label of the attachment question.
The handler will use this name to locate the attachment file within the Remedy
forms of the Kinetic Request application. If more than three attachments are
needed, it is recommended to create additional Work Info entries.

This handler is safe to use in a subtree because it does not rely on any @base 
information to process. All data is passed into the handler as parameters.
