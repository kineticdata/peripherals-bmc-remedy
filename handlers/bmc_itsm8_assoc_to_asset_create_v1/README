=== Detailed Description
This handler creates a record in the AST:CMDB Associations form based on the
information input by the end user, and returns the Request ID of the record 
created.  The handler is just half of the equation. It should be used in
conjunction with bmc_itsm8_assoc_to_X_create where X is the type of record
you are creating an association with, ex. change, incident, contract.
