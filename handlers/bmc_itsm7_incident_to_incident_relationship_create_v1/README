=== Detailed Description
A proper relationship between two Incidents within ITSM is to have two relationships,
Ticket 1 to Ticket 2, and Ticket 2 to Ticket 1.  Use two task nodes for this, as the 
input parameter values are switched between the two HPD:Associations records.

The following data is used to create the 'HPD:Associations' record:
* References the summary field values for the identified tickets from the HPD:Help Desk 
  form.
  - 'Request Description01'         => Value returned by the lookup of the summary description of Incident Number 1
* Maps the following field values of the HPD_Associations form to the field values provided:
  - 'Form Name01'                   => 'HPD:Help Desk'
  - 'Form Name02'                   => 'HPD:Help Desk'
  - 'Request Type01'                => 'Incident'
* Maps the following field values to the values of the specified parameters:
  - 'Request ID01'                  => "Incident Number 1"
  - 'Request ID02'                  => "Incident Number 2"
  - 'Association Type01'            => "Association Type"
